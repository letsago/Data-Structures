# Data Structure Implementations

Hello and welcome to this README! This documents my implementations of the majority of data structures in C++.

## How to run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/letsago/Data-Structures.git
cd Data-Structures/Practice/
git clone https://flashhire.visualstudio.com/_git/Reference
. ~/Data-Structures/Practice/Reference/tools/setup.sh
make run
```

## Directory Structure

Note that each project folder has a `makefile` and `makefile.exp` used for code compilation.
All test cases were written using [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) framework.
Memory leak checks were done via Valgrind.

Folders Containing Data Structure Implementations
* PigLatin
* pyu_libs/pyu

Folders Containing Test Implementations
* Array			
* BalancedTree
* Graph 
* LinearStorageInterface
* LinkedList
* Map
* OrderedSet
* Queue
* Shared_Ptr
* Stack
* Tree 
* Vector

## Known issues

## Completed Ideas
- [x] Vector
- [x] PigLatin
- [x] Linked List
- [x] Interitance Model
- [x] Array
- [x] Circular Buffer
- [x] Queue [via Vector / Linked List / Array / Rolling Array]
- [x] Stack [via Vector / Linked List / Array]
- [x] Shared Pointers
- [x] Binary Tree [Inorder Traversal / Breadth-first Traversal / Depth-first Traversal / Visualization]
- [x] Self-balancing Binary Tree
- [x] Ordered Set
- [x] Ordered Map
- [ ] Unordered Set
- [x] Unordered Map
- [x] Iterators for all above data structures
- [x] Graph [Shortest Distance (BFS)]
- [x] Weighted Graph [Shortest Distance (BFS)]

## Potential future work
- [ ] More efficient Self-Balancing BST
- [ ] Heaps
- [ ] Tries
- [ ] Unique Pointers
