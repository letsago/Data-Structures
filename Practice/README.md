# Data Structure Implementations

Hello and welcome to this README! This documents my implementations of the majority of data structures in C++.

## How to run

```bash
git clone https://flashhire@dev.azure.com/flashhire/PatrickYu/_git/PatrickYu
cd PatrickYu/Practice
source ~/References/tools/setup.sh
make run
```

## Directory Structure

Note that each project folder has a `makefile` and `makefile.exp used` for code compilation.
All test cases were written using [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) framework.

Folders Containing Data Structure Implementations
* PigLatin
* pyu_libs/pyu

Folders Containing Test Implementations

* BalancedTree
* Graph 
* LinearStorageInterface
* LinkedList
* Map
* OrderedSet
* Queue
* Stack
* Tree 
* Shared_Ptr
* Vector

- [x] Shared Pointers
- [x] Binary Tree
    - [x] Inorder Traversal
    - [x] Breadth-first Traversal
